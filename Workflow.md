## Folder Management Guidelines

Proper folder management is essential for streamlining the development workflow. Follow these steps for each issue you work on:

### Step 1: Create Root Project Folder

Firstly, create a root folder for your project. The folder name should match the name of the GitHub repository. To do this via terminal, run:
```bash
mkdir HCI-Final-Project
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Root Folder

Get inside your root folder using the `cd` command:
```bash
cd HCI-Final-Project
```

### Step 3: Create Issue-Specific Folder

Inside the root folder, create a new folder with the same name as your issue prefix. For instance, if you are working on issue `ISSUE-1`, create a folder named `ISSUE-1`:
```bash
mkdir ISSUE-1
```

Then get inside of that folder:
```bash
cd ISSUE-1
```

### Step 4: Clone the Repository

For every new issue you work on, clone the repository again. Given that this is a small-scale project, cloning multiple times should not be a problem. To clone, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HCI-Class-Project/final-project.git
```

### Step 5: Navigate to the Repository Folder

Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd final-project
```

### Step 6: Open the Project in PyCharm

Finally, open the repository folder through PyCharm. This will automatically download any dependencies and set up the project for you.

To open the project, either:
- Use the PyCharm interface and navigate to `File -> Open`, then choose the `final-project` folder.
- Or drag and drop the `final-project` folder into IntelliJ IDEA.

By following these steps, you'll maintain a clean and organized workspace for each issue you tackle.

## Cloning the Repository

If you haven't already cloned the repository:

1. **Code Button**: On the main repo page, you'll see a green "Code" button. Click it.
2. **HTTPS**: Make sure you're on the HTTPS tab and copy the link.
3. **Terminal**: Open your terminal, navigate to where you want the repo, and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HCI-Class-Project/final-project.git
    ```

## How to Pull Branch Updates

To receive the changes that were made to all the branches since the last time you pulled/cloned the repo use:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

**IMPORTANT**: If you are using this git command while working on a same branch with colleague, you might get merge conflicts if your colleague has pushed any code.  

---

## Creating an Issue

1. **Go to GitHub Repo**: Navigate to the repository (Repo) on GitHub.
2. **Issue Tab**: Click on the "Issues" tab next to "Code".
3. **New Issue**: Click on the "New Issue" button.
4. **Template & Details**:
    - **Title**: Make the title "ISSUE-#" where '#' is the number issue we are on, and the give small description of feature you are going to implement.
    - **Description**: Write a simple description on what you're going to be implementing.
    - **Assignees**: On the right sidebar, If you are creating this issue for yourself click `assign yourself`, if not click `Assignees` and list of collaborators will pop up, then assign them to the issue.
    - **Labels**: Under `Assignees`, you’ll see a "Labels" section. Click and select appropriate labels for your issue (Time interval label, and label for what kind of issue this is, it would normally be `feature` label).
    - **Projects**: Find the project that his issue belongs to, it will be named normally `Bookstore-API: Sprint-# (from date - to date)`
    - **Milestone**: Underneath `Projects`, you’ll see "Milestone". Click and assign a milestone if it aligns with one (`API Implementation` is the current milestone we use).
5. **Submit**: Click on "Submit new issue".

## Creating a Branch

After you've created an issue, it's good practice to create a new branch for that issue.

1. **While in issue**: on bottom left on the right sidebar, there is section called development, click "create branch".
2. **Branch creation**: There are 3 sections you need to decide on:
    1. **Branch Name**: Branch name can be the same as the issue name.
    2. **Repository Destination**: If you are creating out of master, leave it as is, if not: 
        1. Click **Change branch source**
        2. Choose the branch you want to branch out of.
    3. **What's next?**: out of the 3 options choose **Checkout locally**
3. **Create branch**: Click the `Create branch button.
    1. After clicking, a pop-up window will appear that will help you `fetch` and `checkout` to the next branch.

## Switching to the New Branch

1. **Terminal**: Navigate to your cloned repo directory.
2. **Fetch and Checkout**: Run the following commands to fetch the latest branches and switch to your new one.
    ```bash
    git fetch
    git checkout [your-branch-name]
    ```

---

## Making Changes and Pushing Code

1. **Code**: Make your code changes.
2. **Terminal**: Navigate to your repo directory.
3. **Commit**: Stage and commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```
4. **Push**: Push the changes to the remote repo:
    ```bash
    git push origin [your-branch-name]
    ```

---

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Go to GitHub Repo**: Navigate back to the repo on GitHub.
2. **Pull Requests Tab**: Click the "Pull Requests" tab next to "Code".
3. **New Pull Request**: Click on "New Pull Request".
4. **Branches**: In the "compare" dropdown, choose the branch you were working on.
5. **Review & Create**: Review your changes and then click "Create Pull Request".
