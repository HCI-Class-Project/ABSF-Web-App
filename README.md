# Read Me - HCI Final Project
- This is the shared repository for the UI/UX Design with Streamlit project. The group currently exists of Anthony, Omar and Massimo.

**BEFORE ANYTHING, MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL GIT at https://git-scm.com/downloads**

For simplicity's sake, the steps to use GitHub for this project is:

- 1. "mkdir HCI-Final-Project" in the HCI folder we've been using all semester.
  2. "cd HCI-Final-Project" to change directory to what you just created.
  3. "git clone https://github.com/HCI-Class-Project/final-project.git" to clone this GitHub repository there.
  4. "git init" in case it gives you a "fatal: not a git repository..." error.
  5. "cd final-project" to change directory to the main file with all the important stuff.

Whenever you want to push, or commit the changes you made to GitHub, do the following:
- 1. git add .
  2. git commit -m "message you want to put here"
  3. git push origin main (this is if creating issues and pull requests gives issues, just push to main. just try and make sure everything works before doing this.)

If we're gonna go the route of creating issues and using pull requests (to make sure things work before putting changes in the main branch), refer to the workflow file as it goes in more detail.
